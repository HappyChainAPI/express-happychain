Connecting to the [HappyCha.in API](https://www.HappyCha.in) has never been easier!

### Getting Started

First we'll install `happychain`.

```shell
$ npm install --save happychain
```

Then create our server in `index.js`.

```shell
$ touch index.js
```
```js
var happychain = require('happychain');

happychain.getBalance();
```

Now let's start our server.

```shell
$ node index.js
```


That's it!
